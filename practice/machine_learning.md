## Warm-Ups
 
### What are eigenvectors and eigenvalues? TODO

### What is an eigendecomposition? What is singular value decomposition (SVD)? How do they relate? TODO

### What is the bias of a model? What is its variance? TODO

### What are overfitting and underfitting? How do they relate to bias and variance? TODO 

### Explain gradient descent. TODO

### What is regularization? What are some examples? TODO

### What is k-fold cross validation? What about leave-one-out cross validation? TODO

### What is bootstrapping? What is bagging? TODO

### For each of the following models, explain them and mention their assumptions and hyperparaters: linear regression, logistic regression, RIDGE and LASSO regression, hard and soft margin SVM, decision trees, random forests, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor. TODO

### What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). What are its uses? TODO

### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Give some examples of each.  TODO

### Define precision and recall. How do they relate to an $F_1$ score? TODO

### What is the sigmoid function? What are some properties it has? TODO

### What is entropy? What is Gini impurity? TODO

## ML Questions

### Explain batch vs stochastic gradient descent. What are the trade-offs? TODO

### Why do we create train/val/test splits?  TODO

### Explain the Bias-Variance tradeoff. Use an equation and explain to non-technical audiences.  TODO

### Explain random forests. What are their tradeoffs compared to decision trees?  TODO 

### You have trained a logistic classification model and are asked to explain the reason for the classification of a particular data point. How would you use the model weights? How would you explain it without using the model weights?  TODO

### You are training a binary classification model to detect a rare disease. Why might you not want to use model accuracy to evaluate the model? What might you use instead?  TODO

### For a binary classification problem we could use linear regression to predict $y=0,1$, why don't we?  TODO

### What is the difference between a generative and discriminative model? Give an example of each.  TODO

### How do you handle missing or corrupted data?  TODO

### How does pruning for decision trees work? Why do we do it? What are other methods to accomplish this, and why might we prefer pruning?  TODO

### How is k-Nearest Neighbors different from k-means clustering?  TODO

### Explain how ROC curves work.  TODO

### What type of cross validation would you use on time series data?  TODO

### What is the Kernel Trick? Why is it useful?  TODO
