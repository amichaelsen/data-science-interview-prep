# Interview Prep

This is a collection of resources for preparing for technical data science interviews. Material is grouped by topic, within each topic there is a collection of "Warm Up" questions, that cover basic definitions, theorems, and models. While presented as questions, these are more for practicing the basics that might get used in interview questions. For each technical interview section the questions are listed at the top as a table of contents with links to the answers down below. 


The last section provides links to resources used in compiling this list of questions as well as additional resources that might be useful in preparing.
